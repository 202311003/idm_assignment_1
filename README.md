# TEAM ID - T27

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression modeling using a weather dataset. The primary objectives include understanding the dataset, preparing it for modeling, and applying various regression techniques to predict a target variable and Hyperparamter Tuning implementation. Below is a summary of the key steps and findings.
